The nautilus's pockmarked hull grew in size as the transit shuttle sliced through the empty space in between the logistics base and the shipyard's hangar. The Nautilus was an old icebreaker, a medium sized vessel designed to smash into asteroids. It was oddly shaped compared to more contemporary vessels, a large dome that held the bridge was perched on top of hull that was more wide than it was long. The front of the ship looked like one of the "cow catchers" Dawson had seen on the front of trains in the old westerns his father collected. It was a relic of the now lost optimism from pre-cherub space exploration. There was something beautiful about the inefficiency of colliding headfirst into a space rock hoping to find something of value, and Dawson couldn't help but see the ship as a metaphor for what they did on a daily basis. 

Finding hope in a profoundly shit situation.

"Hangar 1 4000 kliks out, ETA 45min, welcome to Martha's vineyard"

Dawson glanced over thru one half opened eye at the pilot, smoking a cigarette, with his khaki clad legs haphazardly crossed on top of the multitude of instruments no longer necessary to pilot the shuttle. Everything drove itself nowadays, in fact Dawson always wondered why they even had pilots in the first place. Maybe it was just to make humans feel useful in an era in which manual labour had long disappeared. Unless you where born in the wrong quadrant of the solar system of course. Some things never change he concluded.

Dawson could just barley hear Beth and Harold discussing the the pre-mission checklist over the hum of his own thoughts. 

"- gone over the modifications, I would have preferred the reactor but solar sails should be fine, it's just for redundancy anyways."

"Roger, I've double checked the cryo chamber's manifest, I'm still not feeling great about taking such a long nap but Barne's engineers are diligent, I'll give them that."

"Can you transfer me that manifest, I don't trust those UNSC wrench monkeys, they always have this goddamn look when they..."

Dawson chuckled on the inside.

When Harold applied himself, he was actually quite serious. He still had his moments, but made up for it in with his quick thinking, and Beth's game face helped channel Harold's inner brilliance. Dawson doubted their status as just teammates, but it was the type of question you don't ask, and the type of answer you don't tell. Sometimes it's best to let sleeping dogs lie, and never had Dawson felt that their judgement was comprimised in the thick of a rescue. If anything, their proximity to each other seemed to help them with the stress.

Dawson closed his eyes again, and promptly dozed off knowing the real work hadn't started yet

Dawson awoke with the hissing of the airlock screaming into his ears, and quickly snapped out of his half awake state to unbuckle himself. He looked at the pilot again, this time fully awake, and saw the man now sleeping.

"Sweet gig huh, I guess i'm in the wrong profession"

Dawson looked over and saw Beth struggling to carry multiple bags of equipment out of the shuttle.

"Are you gonna help? Otherwise I have some powder if you want to sit there and look pretty."

Beth didn't worry herself with appearances, let alone makeup, but her point was loud and clear.

Dawson grabbed two bags and followed her out of the shuttle and into the hangar's enormous cavity. Hundreds of ships filled the hangar, some stacked vertically, some disassembled, and the rest occupying every single square cm of space available.

As Dawson looked forward and saw Harold walking swiftly in front of them, covered in bags as well, scanning quickly between the lanes of ships looking for the engineering team leader responsible for the nautilus. 

'I've never seen him like this, what has gotten into him?" 

"He is excited that were alone on this one, while you were sleeping he kept saying this or that about ONI, you know how he is"

"We are not completely alone, CHERUB Â²6 charted the first half of our journey, and we don't die."

"Do you want to tell him that? I sure as hell don't, but i'm not the captain"

"No, you are right. Let's keep it moving."

Beth squeezed his arm and gave him a warm smile.

"Come on, I wanna see what they did to our baby"

Dawson followed her, staring at the ground, lost in his thoughts again.

The Nautilus stood tall, hooked onto the scaffolding outside air lock 165. Too large to fit into the hangar, Dawson watched as the engineers floated around his spacecraft, performing last minute checks to ensure their safe departure.

The Nautilus that looked back at him through the thick view port of the hangar was not the nautilus he knew just a couple days ago. To the untrained eye, it looked identical to the icebreaker it always was, but to Dawson the ship was almost unrecognisable. 

The retractable re-entry wings had been replaced with solar sails, currently folded up like origami, tightly hugging the flanks of the ship. Solar sails where remarkably slow, and relied on radiation pressure exerted by sunlight onto its large surface area. what would normally be a day long voyage would take them almost 4 and a half years. Dawson had inquired about why they were denied a Cherub nav link for their mission, but Barnes remained tight lipped about the subject. Dawson wasn't payed to ask questions, and they were getting a payment of a lifetime anyways.

On the aft section of the hull he noticed a 4 large hydrogen thrusters. The thrusters were "capable" of recycling the most common element in the universe into fuel, but anybody that had already relied on them knew the bittersweet reality that they rarely worked without large amounts of workarounds and tinkering. Barnes reassured them that they would't need to use the solar sails but Dawson knew better. Barnes had been in the bridge too long, and seemingly forgot the true conditions of working in deep space.

As the engineers moved in silence with their helmet mounted lights shining spotlights onto the dull shineless hull, battered by many missions, Dawson noticed something that had previously escaped his scrutiny. 

The hull was different. The same, but different. 

While he was squinting out of the viewport and racking his brain as to what could have possibly changed, an engineer chimed in, seemingly aware of exactly what Dawson was thinking about.

"Thy she thicka than a rememberance of ya past"

Dawson turned around from hearing the thick patois of the outer colonies.
