The nautilus's pockmarked hull grew in size as the transit shuttle sliced through the empty space in between the logistics base and the shipyard's hangar. The Nautilus was an old icebreaker, a medium sized vessel designed to smash into asteroids. It was oddly shaped compared to more contemporary vessels, a large dome that held the bridge was perched on top of hull that was more wide than it was long. The front of the ship looked like one of the "cow catchers" Dawson had seen on the front of trains in the old westerns his father collected. It was a relic of the now lost optimism from pre-cherub space exploration. There was something beautiful about the inefficiency of colliding headfirst into a space rock hoping to find something of value, and Dawson couldn't help but see the ship as a metaphor for what they did on a daily basis. 

Finding hope in a profoundly shit situation.

"Hangar 1 4000 kliks out, ETA 45min, welcome to Martha's vineyard"

Dawson glanced over thru one half opened eye at the pilot, smoking a cigarette, with his khaki clad legs haphazardly crossed on top of the multitude of instruments no longer necessary to pilot the shuttle. Everything drove itself nowadays, in fact Dawson always wondered why they even had pilots in the first place. Maybe it was just to make humans feel useful in an era in which manual labour had long disappeared. Unless you where born in the wrong quadrant of the solar system of course. Some things never change he concluded.

Dawson could just barley hear Beth and Harold discussing the the pre-mission checklist over the hum of his own thoughts. 

"- gone over the modifications, I would have preferred the reactor but solar sails should be fine, it's just for redundancy anyways."

"Roger, I've double checked the cryo chamber's manifest, I'm still not feeling great about taking such a long nap but Barne's engineers are diligent, I'll give them that."

"Can you transfer me that manifest, I don't trust those UNSC wrench monkeys, they always have this goddamn look when they..."

Dawson chuckled on the inside.

When Harold applied himself, he was actually quite serious. He still had his moments, but made up for it in with his quick thinking, and Beth's game face helped channel Harold's inner brilliance. Dawson doubted their status as just teammates, but it was the type of question you don't ask, and the type of answer you don't tell. Sometimes it's best to let sleeping dogs lie, and never had Dawson felt that their judgement was comprimised in the thick of a rescue. If anything, their proximity to each other seemed to help them with the stress.

Dawson closed his eyes again, and promptly dozed off knowing the real work hadn't started yet

----

Dawson awoke with the hissing of the airlock screaming into his ears, and quickly snapped out of his half awake state to unbuckle himself. He looked at the pilot again, this time fully awake, and saw the man now sleeping.

"Sweet gig huh, I guess i'm in the wrong profession"

Dawson looked over and saw Beth struggling to carry multiple bags of equipment out of the shuttle.

"Are you gonna help? Otherwise I have some powder if you want to sit there and look pretty."

Beth didn't worry herself with appearances, let alone makeup, but her point was loud and clear.

Dawson grabbed two bags and followed her out of the shuttle and into the hangar's enormous cavity. Hundreds of ships filled the hangar, some stacked vertically, some disassembled, and the rest occupying every single square cm of space available.

As Dawson looked forward and saw Harold walking swiftly in front of them, covered in bags as well, scanning quickly between the lanes of ships looking for the engineering team leader responsible for the nautilus. 

'I've never seen him like this, what has gotten into him?" 

"He is excited that were alone on this one, while you were sleeping he kept saying this or that about ONI, you know how he is"

"We are not completely alone, CHERUB ²6 charted the first half of our journey, and we don't die."

"Do you want to tell him that? I sure as hell don't, but i'm not the captain"

"No, you are right. Let's keep it moving."

Beth squeezed his arm and gave him a warm smile.

"Come on, I wanna see what they did to our baby"

Dawson followed her, staring at the ground, lost in his thoughts again.

----

The Nautilus stood tall, hooked onto the scaffolding outside air lock 165. Too large to fit into the hangar, Dawson watched as the engineers floated around his spacecraft, performing last minute checks to ensure their safe departure.

The Nautilus that looked back at him through the thick view port of the hangar was not the nautilus he knew just a couple days ago. To the untrained eye, it looked identical to the icebreaker it always was, but to Dawson the ship was almost unrecognisable. 

The retractable re-entry wings had been replaced with solar sails, currently folded up like origami, tightly hugging the flanks of the ship. Solar sails where remarkably slow, and relied on radiation pressure exerted by sunlight onto its large surface area. what would normally be a day long voyage would take them almost 4 and a half years. Dawson had inquired about why they were denied a Cherub nav link for their mission, but Barnes remained tight lipped about the subject. Dawson wasn't payed to ask questions, and they were getting a payment of a lifetime anyways.

On the aft section of the hull he noticed a 4 large hydrogen thrusters. The thrusters were "capable" of recycling the most common element in the universe into fuel, but anybody that had already relied on them knew the bittersweet reality that they rarely worked without large amounts of workarounds and tinkering. Barnes reassured them that they would't need to use the solar sails but Dawson knew better. Barnes had been in the bridge too long, and seemingly forgot the true conditions of working in deep space.

As the engineers moved in silence with their helmet mounted lights shining spotlights onto the dull shineless hull, battered by many missions, Dawson noticed something that had previously escaped his scrutiny. 

The hull was different. The same, but different. 

While he was squinting out of the viewport and racking his brain as to what could have possibly changed, an engineer chimed in, seemingly aware of exactly what Dawson was thinking about.

"Why ishe thicka than a rememberance of ya past dontchathink?"

Dawson turned around from hearing the thick patois of the outer colonies. In front of him he saw a very tall man, almost 2,5 meters tall. Wearing blue overalls splotched with various greases and fluids, the man held a very gruff appearance. Thick, vascular arms draped around the man's torso, with a face to match.

"what do you mean?"

"Radiashun" 

The engineers accent was heavy, with rolling r's and the syllables seemingly melting together to form a dialect Dawson unfortunately knew all too well.

"Radiation?"

The engineer beamed an asymmetrically toothless smile and walked a way, singing a song with incomprehensible lyrics as he swung his wrench lazily by his side with every step.

Dawson returned his gaze to the Nautilus, sitting there faithfully, and he understood. The hull was much thicker than usual, the outer walls having grown by at least a meter. The nautilus was already rated for heavy radiation, as it routinely slingshotted it's way past the sun using whatever celestial body it could get it's hands on. But this much protection could only mean one thing. 

They were going to get closer than they ever had before.

The nautilus's crew sat calmly around the dinner table enjoying their last meal before going under. Harold, who prided himself in being a great home cook, had prepared for them a lunar delicacy. Some type of stew devoid of meat, and flavour as well. Dawson thought it was bland, but knowing the lunarians, that was the whole point.

"Captain could you do me a favour and look like you actually want to come with us every once in a while? What does a brother have to do? Hang up a pinata and do the cancan?"

Dawson didn't have the heart to say they would probably be gone for much longer than 1 year.

"I'll be sleeping, peacefully. You'll have to hang the pinata over my inanimate body if you want to have your fiesta."

Dawson said with the slightest of smiles

"see, this is the shit that gets to me. You must be great at parties captain."

"The best"

"Get a load of this guy Beth, underneath that hard exterior is just another hard exterior. What a fucking buzzkill."

Beth sat there eating her flavourless lunarian stew, pouring over the mission details that they had all heard 100 times over. She paid no attention to Harold's attempts at lifting the mood.

"Shall we go over it one last time captain?"

She said softly 

"I'm all ears"

Beth sat up straight and cleared her throat. She grabbed the portable terminal and layed it flat on the table.

"Nautilus, commence recording"

"Recording" 

"The UNSC wants us to recover 13 crew members aboard the SOLARIS 2, recover the payload, and bring them back before Barnes retires so he can get his shiny medals. All this is offically for the UNSC, but we all know who is running the show. For OPSEC they won't disclose what the payload is, but I'm sure we'll know it when we see it. SOLARIS 2 stopped transmitting SITREP's a little under 1 year ago, and as Barnes said during the briefing, we have little information as where they can be. CHERUB ²6 has crunched some numbers to help us whittle down the possibilities"

Harold shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his sarcastic smile gone.

"Best case scenario is that they are orbiting mercury after a comms failure. They have enough provisions and life support to survive multiple decades, so in this scenario, they are sitting ducks waiting for uncle sam to pick them up. Worst case scenario, they are all dead and the ship has slingshotted it's way out of the solar system."

"²6 doesn't miss, whats the most likely scenario?"

"Well captain, SOLARIS 2 was meant to orbit the sun, and deliver the payload from said orbit. ²6 is almost certain something must have happened during the payload release. SOLARIS 2 is designed to withstand the heat and radiation of the sun, but us no. Once we enter the suns orbit, our radiation and heat protection will degrade rapidly. We will have roughly 3 days to get in and get out."

Harold slammed the table with a closed fist, his grey stew sloshing onto the table.

"So you're telling me, ONI has us following a babies intuition on where they might be? They know exactly where SOLARIS 2 and they're feeding us red herrings Beth. That crew is as good as dead, all they want is the payload back. The payload that they won't even disclose by the way."

"He has a point"

Beth looked up calmly

"Tunnelling will get us to the Venus hydrogen accumulator for a refuel tomorrow, at that point we are alone. ²6's itinerary has us covered until Venus, and we will complete the trip on hydrogen fuel, or god forbid, solar wind. After Venus our progress will slow down as the nautilus will have to travel 108 million kilometres without CHERUB clairvoyance. That's when we sleep. Hydrogen should get us to mercury in about a year, and solar wind will quadruple that number."
