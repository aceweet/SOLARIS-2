Harold sat laying in his bunk. 

Staring

Thinking

Beth was in the botanical garden 

Snipping 

Shaking

And Dawson sat there cross legged in front of a huge glass vat with the words “CHERUB ²6” Stencilled where the glass met the floor. A small being floated in the G fluid, its flesh a translucent peach colour. Despite their appearance, Dawson wasn’t sure if you could call them “kids” as Beth fondly referred to them as. They where technically human, but were stripped of their humanity long before they were even born. 

As Dawson’s thoughts shifted, Cherub ²6 detected his presence awoke from her slumber and spun around in her habitat with a flurry of bubbles. She peered at him with a piercingly enigmatic stare. Dawson smiled slightly and waved. The g fluid suddenly became cloudy and after a moment, an infants hand emerged from the “fog” and gave an attempt at a wave. The cherubs had really come a long way.   

As a child Dawson spent many a days at the holodeck pouring over all the tapes he could get his hands on, with a particular interest in deep space travel. ONI tried their best to keep the CHERUB program a secret. In fact it was quite possibly humanity’s greatest secret. But Dawson’s father was a collector of sorts, and like any good collector he liked rare objects. 

Like tapes

And Dawson was a collector of information, certainly a different type of collector, but a good collector at that, just like his father.

The first cherubs were a tangled mess of flesh, derived from the DNA of many people, spliced together to achieve the most raw computing power. It was hard to look at for many, a symbol of raw scientific progress unencumbered by morals or ethics. The results were astounding, as long as you didn’t look too hard into the deaths surrounding the project. They seemed to never end, a long list of suicides, and murders and deaths so unexplainable they were simply deemed supernatural by cultists that had infiltrated ONI. 

The official story was one of political strife and dissidence over ownership of such a huge source of prediction power, but as anybody close to ONI knew all too well, the official story was just a cover. 

The cherubs were presented as flesh computers capable of easing deep space travel by predicting the short term future, but they were far more than that, they had emotions, states of mind, and desires. 

The first incident involved Dr. C Halsey, a quantum physicist known for her soft caring demeanour and deep intellect. Cherub 1 had developed a certain level of “interest” in Dr.Halsey’s maternal instinct. This is how the ONI suits described the situation, but to any rational human being it was clear that cherub 1 was in love with what it perceived as its mother. 

There was only one problem, and that was Dr.Halsey’s wife. After a long week of intense work completed in earth’s orbit, she returned home to see her wife, on the ground, inside out.

A pulsating pile of flesh just alive enough to call out halsey’s name.  

Halsey promptly shot what was left of her wife, went into her bedroom, and shot herself. Not out of sadness, or hopelessness. But out of fear. A bullet was infinitely less painful than whatever cherub 1 could possibly do to her on one of it’s “off” days. 

Ever since, ONI had done everything to remove the emotional faculties of the infants. Over the last century, massive progress was made. They looked more and more like normal babies, they became slowly more disinterested in human interaction as they focused almost solely on their massive calculations, and after the “disclosure” the progress had advanced so much that the general public felt no fear around the cherubs. In fact, the culture seemed to embrace the cherubs, as they represented an era of unprecedented deep space travel. 

But people like Harold knew better. Despite his brash demeanour, he was a talented quantum physicist. As he started to make serious progress on his research towards the hard question of consciousness, a field previously dominated by neurologists and bio chemists, ONI stepped in.

This did not please Harold.

He suddenly understood that ONI was playing with the fabric of reality itself, through the lens of consciousness. Hell, who wasn’t to say that they were one in the same? The cherubs seemed to have a manipulation of reality scarier than reality itself. 

Harold was always the smartest person on the team, and his intelligence was hidden by a great amount of pain. And that pain was hidden by what most would describe as a shit sense of humour. ONI had made people in his life disappear. Not the regular two projectiles to the back of the head disappear, but the type of vanishing so profound that it’s almost as if the person never existed. Family members didn’t seem to notice or remember people vanishing from their lives. 

This terrified Harold.

When Harold first met Beth and Dawson, He jumped on the opportunity to work with them. It was a new start for all of them. And they formed a good team too. With over 70 deep space recovery missions completed together, the UNSC developed an interest in their efficiency as a team. 

Beth initially disliked Harold, but as they worked together their chemistry was undeniable. Unbeknownst to Dawson, they had slept together on multiple missions. Beth hated Harold’s unapologetic personality but was strangely attracted to it at the same time. He knew how to press her buttons, mentally and physically. Beth wasn’t one to settle down, but sometimes she fantasized about it, a whole imaginary life with Harold by her side. Harold was the smartest man she knew even if he didn’t look the part. 

As a as a doctor she had saved many lives in deep space. Harold handled all the logistical challenges, allowing her to concentrate on giving treatment to patients deeply traumatized by long periods of time in deep space.

And Dawson was their captain, a retired naval officer, with a large amount of practical experience navigating deep space in high stress situations. Deep space rescues were a walk in the park, well at least compared to zero gravity infantry combat. Dawson had killed many men, but strangely enough had a father like compassion that brought the team together to perform as a unit.

The vat swooshed as CHERUB ²6 swirled in her fluids.

Dawson slowly stood up. 

“have a good night, if you even sleep”

Dawson said in a sleepy voice as he walked out of the nav center, and into the dimly lit labyrinth of the logistics station’s hallways.
