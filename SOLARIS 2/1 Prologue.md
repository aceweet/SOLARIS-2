Dawson stared emptily into the terminal as he flicked what was left of his cigarette onto the laminated oak desk sprawled out in front of him. Out of the corner of his eye he observed the ashes snowing slowly until they landed underneath his hand, stained with blood from the cracks flowing jaggedly down his fingers like canyons. His fingers where twitching but his mind was remarkably still.

SUDO SUPERUSER ACCESS REQUIRED: ENTER IDENTIFICATION 

“Ok, hit me with it” he said dryly

The rusty talkbox next to him transmitted a stressed female voice into his head;

“Alpha Romero Delta bet…”

Dawson typed everything he heard, he could barley hear his own thoughts over the click clack of the mechanical keyboard and the life support system humming in the ducts above him.

“Dawson can you fucking hear me? Did you get all that?” 

He looked at the time 

8:13 Am

Had it already been 6 minutes?

He flicked the nonexsistant ash from the melted filter he was squeezing bewteen his fingers and responded.

“Roger, he won’t snap out of it, terminal is stuck in some god forsaken process. Beth do you think you could poke ar…”

As he spoke the terminal sprung to life, the screen filled with collumns of seemingly random characters fluttering down the screen. It stopped. Suddenly:  

“HI DAWSON DO YOU WANNA PLAY?”

Dawson felt like screaming, but the only action he could muster was slowly closing his eyes and pulling a long imaginary hit off his dead cigarette butt.
