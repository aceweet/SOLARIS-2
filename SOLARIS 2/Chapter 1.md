*Watch out, pacing. needs more space inbetween story beats*

Dawson stared at his naval academy issued boots as Commander Barnes droned away, his vague hand movements and mannerisms distorted by the hologram in between the two men.   

As Barnes relayed a seemingly endless speech of irrelevant details, Harold cut him off.

“Barnes cut to the goddamn fucking chase before I lose it, never in my years have I heard such a bullshit briefing”

“Harold, the more red tape, the more exciting the rescue. You know how this shit goes.” Beth quipped.

Barnes, unfazed, continued his monologue.

“Last communication with Solaris 2 was intercepted 362 days ago. No SOS, no procedural message, no CHERUB frequncies. They just disappeared out of space time and ONI will have my head if I don’t find their darling. In fact they will not just have my head they will display it in the holodeck with the words COURT MARSHALL ACROSS MY FUKING FORHEAD!”

Barnes sudden outburst snapped Dawson out of the intense thought process currently domineering his attention span.

“What do you mean no CHERUB frequencies Barnes?”

“Not a peep”

“What the hell do you expect us to do than Barnes?”  

“We’re doing things the old fashioned way, silicon navigation and hard calculations to triangulate their location”

Suddenly, Harold jumped out of his seat.

“It’s about FUCKING TIME, How long have I been saying this shit Beth? Fuck those things and fuck ONI and their “intelligence”. I think we oughta say fuck it and leave them to di…”

She cut him off   

“Harold this irrational fear of children is starting to get out of hand, please pipe down before saying something profoundly dumb. Do you really expect us to leave SOLARIS to die just because you don’t like the infants? Get a grip and grow up. This is what we do and you knew that when you signed up”

“Bullshit” Harold mumbled thru a wry smile, his hand white knuckling a pen, seemingly displaying how he truly felt inside.

Afraid

And Dawson knew it.

----------------------------

As Dawson sat in the mess hall to collect his thoughts, he saw his teammates approach, bickering as usual, with two trays holding two very different meals. Harold’s tray carried an almost comical amount of food, the spaghetti overflowing onto the desert. Beth’s tray represented a much more balanced meal, maybe too balanced for her own good. Rabbit food doesn’t get you through traumatic experiences, comfort food does, Dawson thought to himself.

“Why the long face captain O’captain, I’m starting to think you don’t like me.”

Harold said, a singular noodle hanging off the edge of his tray as he got closer.

“Do you hear yourself talk or do you just say whatever thought comes through your head? Can’t you see he’s thinking?” 

Dawson looked at them both and felt a certain warmth underneath the slight annoyance of hearing them argue needlessly.

“sit down we need to talk, and please concentrate I’m not messing around on this one”

They both sat down, Harold seemingly more concentrated on whether to start with the pudding or the salad than listening, meanwhile Beth sat with her arms crossed, staring at Dawson over her glasses as her food sat untouched. 

“ONI wants us to find the solaris 2, I tried doing my homework but everything is classified, down to the shoe size of the crew. Reached out to TARDUS 6 and they informed me of the true nature of the solaris program. Barnes is not being honest about everything” 

Harold almost choked on his food, and than erupted into laughter.

“So your telling me the office of naval intelligence is lying” 

Harold stated sarcastically as he promptly resumed his feast.  

“The sun is dying”

Harold froze mid bite and looked up, Beth’s posture remain unchanged.

“we are only a couple thousand years away from the sun dying, which explains the current living conditions on earth. ONI wants this under wraps for obvious reasons. Solaris 2 was launched from Martian orbit 7 years ago carrying a payload so secret I’m assuming it has to be the mother of all bombs.”

Beth broke her silence

“ONI never ceases to amaze me with their ability to throw bombs at every single one of their problems. Are you sure about this captain?”

“No, but what I am sure of is that if it’s not a bomb it must be way worse. Not even the Senators are aware of this. Its real spooky shit”

Dawson paused, looked back down at his boots, and resumed

“Our search and rescue operation is under the same classification, I looked us up, We no longer exist. The nautilus is undergoing the necessary modifications to carry us into mercury’s orbit as we speak. We leave at 0300 hours in two earth days”  

“What the fuck do you mean we don’t exist, I’m sitting hear having the conversation of a lifetime with my favourite captain and your telling me I don’t exist?”

“I’m telling you we don’t exist, would you like me to draw a picture Harold?”

Beth looked bothered  

“Mercury is almost deep space, are we getting there via CHERUB?”

“Won’t need one, time isn’t of the essence. We will enter Cryosleep”

“Whoa, nobody talked about fucking cryosleep. I’ve never gone under and I don’t plan on starting now”

Harold promptly got up with a smile so wide it could have wrapped around his head.

“There is a first time for everything Beth, I for one, am looking forward to it”

Dawson saw the fear not in Harold this time, but in Beth’s unwavering stare.

---

*I have to rewrite this section, the exposition is awful lmao*

---

Harold sat laying in his bunk. 

Staring

Thinking

Beth was in the botanical garden 

Snipping 

Shaking

And Dawson sat there cross legged in front of a huge glass vat with the words “CHERUB ²6” Stencilled where the glass met the floor. A small being floated in the G fluid, its flesh a translucent peach colour. Despite their appearance, Dawson wasn’t sure if you could call them “kids” as Beth fondly referred to them as. They where technically human, but were stripped of their humanity long before they were even born. 

As Dawson’s thoughts shifted, Cherub ²6 detected his presence awoke from her slumber and spun around in her habitat with a flurry of bubbles. She peered at him with a piercingly enigmatic stare. Dawson smiled slightly and waved. The g fluid suddenly became cloudy and after a moment, an infants hand emerged from the “fog” and gave an attempt at a wave. The cherubs had really come a long way.   

As a child Dawson spent many a days at the holodeck pouring over all the tapes he could get his hands on, with a particular interest in deep space travel. ONI tried their best to keep the CHERUB program a secret. In fact it was quite possibly humanity’s greatest secret. But Dawson’s father was a collector of sorts, and like any good collector he liked rare objects. 

Like tapes

And Dawson was a collector of information, certainly a different type of collector, but a good collector at that, just like his father.

The first cherubs were a tangled mess of flesh, derived from the DNA of many people, spliced together to achieve the most raw computing power. It was hard to look at for many, a symbol of raw scientific progress unencumbered by morals or ethics. The results were astounding, as long as you didn’t look too hard into the deaths surrounding the project. They seemed to never end, a long list of suicides, and murders and deaths so unexplainable they were simply deemed supernatural by cultists that had infiltrated ONI. 

The official story was one of political strife and dissidence over ownership of such a huge source of prediction power, but as anybody close to ONI knew all too well, the official story was just a cover. 

The cherubs were presented as flesh computers capable of easing deep space travel by predicting the short term future, but they were far more than that, they had emotions, states of mind, and desires. 

The first incident involved Dr. C Halsey, a quantum physicist known for her soft caring demeanour and deep intellect. Cherub 1 had developed a certain level of “interest” in Dr.Halsey’s maternal instinct. This is how the ONI suits described the situation, but to any rational human being it was clear that cherub 1 was in love with what it perceived as its mother. 

There was only one problem, and that was Dr.Halsey’s wife. After a long week of intense work completed in earth’s orbit, she returned home to see her wife, on the ground, inside out.

A pulsating pile of flesh just alive enough to call out halsey’s name.  

Halsey promptly shot what was left of her wife, went into her bedroom, and shot herself. Not out of sadness, or hopelessness. But out of fear. A bullet was infinitely less painful than whatever cherub 1 could possibly do to her on one of it’s “off” days. 

Ever since, ONI had done everything to remove the emotional faculties of the infants. Over the last century, massive progress was made. They looked more and more like normal babies, they became slowly more disinterested in human interaction as they focused almost solely on their massive calculations, and after the “disclosure” the progress had advanced so much that the general public felt no fear around the cherubs. In fact, the culture seemed to embrace the cherubs, as they represented an era of unprecedented deep space travel. 

But people like Harold knew better. Despite his brash demeanour, he was a talented quantum physicist. As he started to make serious progress on his research towards the hard question of consciousness, a field previously dominated by neurologists and bio chemists, ONI stepped in.

This did not please Harold.

He suddenly understood that ONI was playing with the fabric of reality itself, through the lens of consciousness. Hell, who wasn’t to say that they were one in the same? The cherubs seemed to have a manipulation of reality scarier than reality itself. 

Harold was always the smartest person on the team, and his intelligence was hidden by a great amount of pain. And that pain was hidden by what most would describe as a shit sense of humour. ONI had made people in his life disappear. Not the regular two projectiles to the back of the head disappear, but the type of vanishing so profound that it’s almost as if the person never existed. Family members didn’t seem to notice or remember people vanishing from their lives. 

This terrified Harold.

When Harold first met Beth and Dawson, He jumped on the opportunity to work with them. It was a new start for all of them. And they formed a good team too. With over 70 deep space recovery missions completed together, the UNSC developed an interest in their efficiency as a team. 

Beth initially disliked Harold, but as they worked together their chemistry was undeniable. Unbeknownst to Dawson, they had slept together on multiple missions. Beth hated Harold’s unapologetic personality but was strangely attracted to it at the same time. He knew how to press her buttons, mentally and physically. Beth wasn’t one to settle down, but sometimes she fantasized about it, a whole imaginary life with Harold by her side. Harold was the smartest man she knew even if he didn’t look the part. 

As a as a doctor she had saved many lives in deep space. Harold handled all the logistical challenges, allowing her to concentrate on giving treatment to patients deeply traumatized by long periods of time in deep space.

And Dawson was their captain, a retired naval officer, with a large amount of practical experience navigating deep space in high stress situations. Deep space rescues were a walk in the park, well at least compared to zero gravity infantry combat. Dawson had killed many men, but strangely enough had a father like compassion that brought the team together to perform as a unit.

The vat swooshed as CHERUB ²6 swirled in her fluids.

Dawson slowly stood up. 

“have a good night, if you even sleep”

Dawson said in a sleepy voice as he walked out of the nav center, and into the dimly lit labyrinth of the logistics station’s hallways.

---

The nautilus's pockmarked hull grew in size as the transit shuttle sliced through the empty space in between the logistics base and the shipyard's hangar. The Nautilus was an old icebreaker, a medium sized vessel designed to smash into asteroids. It was oddly shaped compared to more contemporary vessels, a large dome that held the bridge was perched on top of hull that was more wide than it was long. The front of the ship looked like one of the "cow catchers" Dawson had seen on the front of trains in the old westerns his father collected. It was a relic of the now lost optimism from pre-cherub space exploration. There was something beautiful about the inefficiency of colliding headfirst into a space rock hoping to find something of value, and Dawson couldn't help but see the ship as a metaphor for what they did on a daily basis. 

Finding hope in a profoundly shit situation.

"Hangar 1 4000 kliks out, ETA 45min, welcome to Martha's vineyard"

Dawson glanced over thru one half opened eye at the pilot, smoking a cigarette, with his khaki clad legs haphazardly crossed on top of the multitude of instruments no longer necessary to pilot the shuttle. Everything drove itself nowadays, in fact Dawson always wondered why they even had pilots in the first place. Maybe it was just to make humans feel useful in an era in which manual labour had long disappeared. Unless you where born in the wrong quadrant of the solar system of course. Some things never change he concluded.

Dawson could just barley hear Beth and Harold discussing the the pre-mission checklist over the hum of his own thoughts. 

"- gone over the modifications, I would have preferred the reactor but solar sails should be fine, it's just for redundancy anyways."

"Roger, I've double checked the cryo chamber's manifest, I'm still not feeling great about taking such a long nap but Barne's engineers are diligent, I'll give them that."

"Can you transfer me that manifest, I don't trust those UNSC wrench monkeys, they always have this goddamn look when they..."

Dawson chuckled on the inside.

When Harold applied himself, he was actually quite serious. He still had his moments, but made up for it in with his quick thinking, and Beth's game face helped channel Harold's inner brilliance. Dawson doubted their status as just teammates, but it was the type of question you don't ask, and the type of answer you don't tell. Sometimes it's best to let sleeping dogs lie, and never had Dawson felt that their judgement was comprimised in the thick of a rescue. If anything, their proximity to each other seemed to help them with the stress.

Dawson closed his eyes again, and promptly dozed off knowing the real work hadn't started yet

----

Dawson awoke with the hissing of the airlock screaming into his ears, and quickly snapped out of his half awake state to unbuckle himself. He looked at the pilot again, this time fully awake, and saw the man now sleeping.

"Sweet gig huh, I guess i'm in the wrong profession"

Dawson looked over and saw Beth struggling to carry multiple bags of equipment out of the shuttle.

"Are you gonna help? Otherwise I have some powder if you want to sit there and look pretty."

Beth didn't worry herself with appearances, let alone makeup, but her point was loud and clear.

Dawson grabbed two bags and followed her out of the shuttle and into the hangar's enormous cavity. Hundreds of ships filled the hangar, some stacked vertically, some disassembled, and the rest occupying every single square cm of space available.

As Dawson looked forward and saw Harold walking swiftly in front of them, covered in bags as well, scanning quickly between the lanes of ships looking for the engineering team leader responsible for the nautilus. 

'I've never seen him like this, what has gotten into him?" 

"He is excited that were alone on this one, while you were sleeping he kept saying this or that about ONI, you know how he is"

"We are not completely alone, CHERUB ²6 charted the first half of our journey, and we don't die."

"Do you want to tell him that? I sure as hell don't, but i'm not the captain"

"No, you are right. Let's keep it moving."

Beth squeezed his arm and gave him a warm smile.

"Come on, I wanna see what they did to our baby"

Dawson followed her, staring at the ground, lost in his thoughts again.

----

The Nautilus stood tall, hooked onto the scaffolding outside air lock 165. Too large to fit into the hangar, Dawson watched as the engineers floated around his spacecraft, performing last minute checks to ensure their safe departure.

The Nautilus that looked back at him through the thick view port of the hangar was not the nautilus he knew just a couple days ago. To the untrained eye, it looked identical to the icebreaker it always was, but to Dawson the ship was almost unrecognisable. 

The retractable re-entry wings had been replaced with solar sails, currently folded up like origami, tightly hugging the flanks of the ship. Solar sails where remarkably slow, and relied on radiation pressure exerted by sunlight onto its large surface area. what would normally be a day long voyage would take them almost 4 and a half years. Dawson had inquired about why they were denied a Cherub nav link for their mission, but Barnes remained tight lipped about the subject. Dawson wasn't payed to ask questions, and they were getting a payment of a lifetime anyways.

On the aft section of the hull he noticed a 4 large hydrogen thrusters. The thrusters were "capable" of recycling the most common element in the universe into fuel, but anybody that had already relied on them knew the bittersweet reality that they rarely worked without large amounts of workarounds and tinkering. Barnes reassured them that they would't need to use the solar sails but Dawson knew better. Barnes had been in the bridge too long, and seemingly forgot the true conditions of working in deep space.

As the engineers moved in silence with their helmet mounted lights shining spotlights onto the dull shineless hull, battered by many missions, Dawson noticed something that had previously escaped his scrutiny. 

The hull was different. The same, but different. 

While he was squinting out of the viewport and racking his brain as to what could have possibly changed, an engineer chimed in, seemingly aware of exactly what Dawson was thinking about.

"Why ishe thicka than a rememberance of ya past dontchathink?"

Dawson turned around from hearing the thick patois of the outer colonies. In front of him he saw a very tall man, almost 2,5 meters tall. Wearing blue overalls splotched with various greases and fluids, the man held a very gruff appearance. Thick, vascular arms draped around the man's torso, with a face to match.

"what do you mean?"

"Radiashun" 

The engineers accent was heavy, with rolling r's and the syllables seemingly melting together to form a dialect Dawson unfortunately knew all too well.

"Radiation?"

The engineer beamed an asymmetrically toothless smile and walked a way, singing a song with incomprehensible lyrics as he swung his wrench lazily by his side with every step.

Dawson returned his gaze to the Nautilus, sitting there faithfully, and he understood. The hull was much thicker than usual, the outer walls having grown by at least a meter. The nautilus was already rated for heavy radiation, as it routinely slingshotted it's way past the sun using whatever celestial body it could get it's hands on. But this much protection could only mean one thing. 

They were going to get closer than they ever had before.

---

The nautilus's crew sat calmly around the dinner table enjoying their last meal before going under. Harold, who prided himself in being a great home cook, had prepared for them a lunar delicacy. Some type of stew devoid of meat, and flavour as well. Dawson thought it was bland, but knowing the lunarians, that was the whole point.

"Captain could you do me a favour and look like you actually want to come with us every once in a while? What does a brother have to do? Hang up a pinata and do the cancan?"

Dawson didn't have the heart to say they would probably be gone for much longer than 1 year.

"I'll be sleeping, peacefully. You'll have to hang the pinata over my inanimate body if you want to have your fiesta."

Dawson said with the slightest of smiles

"see, this is the shit that gets to me. You must be great at parties captain."

"The best"

"Get a load of this guy Beth, underneath that hard exterior is just another hard exterior. What a fucking buzzkill."

Beth sat there eating her flavourless lunarian stew, pouring over the mission details that they had all heard 100 times over. She paid no attention to Harold's attempts at lifting the mood.

"Shall we go over it one last time captain?"

She said softly 

"I'm all ears"

Beth sat up straight and cleared her throat. She grabbed the portable terminal and layed it flat on the table.

"Nautilus, commence recording"

"Recording" 

"The UNSC wants us to recover 13 crew members aboard the SOLARIS 2, recover the payload, and bring them back before Barnes retires so he can get his shiny medals. All this is offically for the UNSC, but we all know who is running the show. For OPSEC they won't disclose what the payload is, but I'm sure we'll know it when we see it. SOLARIS 2 stopped transmitting SITREP's a little under 1 year ago, and as Barnes said during the briefing, we have little information as where they can be. CHERUB ²6 has crunched some numbers to help us whittle down the possibilities"

Harold shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his sarcastic smile gone.

"Best case scenario is that they are orbiting mercury after a comms failure. They have enough provisions and life support to survive multiple decades, so in this scenario, they are sitting ducks waiting for uncle sam to pick them up. Worst case scenario, they are all dead and the ship has slingshotted it's way out of the solar system."

"²6 doesn't miss, whats the most likely scenario?"

"Well captain, SOLARIS 2 was meant to orbit the sun, and deliver the payload from said orbit. ²6 is almost certain something must have happened during the payload release. SOLARIS 2 is designed to withstand the heat and radiation of the sun, but us no. Once we enter the suns orbit, our radiation and heat protection will degrade rapidly. We will have roughly 3 days to get in and get out."

Harold slammed the table with a closed fist, his grey stew sloshing onto the table.

"So you're telling me, ONI has us following a babies intuition on where they might be? They know exactly where SOLARIS 2 and they're feeding us red herrings Beth. That crew is as good as dead, all they want is the payload back. The payload that they won't even disclose by the way."

"He has a point"

Beth looked up calmly

"Tunnelling will get us to the Venus hydrogen accumulator for a refuel tomorrow, at that point we are alone. ²6's itinerary has us covered until Venus, and we will complete the trip on hydrogen fuel, or god forbid, solar wind. After Venus our progress will slow down as the nautilus will have to travel 108 million kilometres without CHERUB clairvoyance. That's when we sleep. Hydrogen should get us to mercury in about a year, and solar wind will quadruple that number." 

Dawson stood up with his empty bowl. 

"This is a suicide mission, and we are the only ass holes suicidal enough to do it. You guys should sleep before we sleep. Good night"

Goodnight captain they said, and before he had even left the kitchen they were already sitting closer together.
