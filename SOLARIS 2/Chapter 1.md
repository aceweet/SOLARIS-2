Vessel : UNSC Corvette class logistics base
Orbit : Earth

Dawson stared at his naval academy issued boots as Commander Barnes droned away, his vague hand movements and mannerisms distorted by the hologram in between the two men.   

As Barnes relayed a seemingly endless speech of irrelevant details, Harold cut him off.

“Barnes cut to the goddamn fucking chase before I lose it, never in my years have I heard such a bullshit briefing”

“Harold, the more red tape, the more exciting the rescue. You know how this shit goes.” Beth quipped.

Barnes, unfazed, continued his monologue.

“Last communication with Solaris 2 was intercepted 362 days ago. No SOS, no procedural message, no CHERUB frequncies. They just disappeared out of space time and ONI will have my head if I don’t find their darling. In fact they will not just have my head they will display it in the holodeck with the words COURT MARSHALL ACROSS MY FUKING FORHEAD!”

Barnes sudden outburst snapped Dawson out of the intense thought process currently domineering his attention span.

“What do you mean no CHERUB frequencies Barnes?”

“Not a peep”

“What the hell do you expect us to do than Barnes?”  

“We’re doing things the old fashioned way, silicon navigation and hard calculations to triangulate their location”

Suddenly, Harold jumped out of his seat.

“It’s about FUCKING TIME, How long have I been saying this shit Beth? Fuck those things and fuck ONI and their “intelligence”. I think we oughta say fuck it and leave them to di…”

She cut him off   

“Harold this irrational fear of children is starting to get out of hand, please pipe down before saying something profoundly dumb. Do you really expect us to leave SOLARIS to die just because you don’t like the infants? Get a grip and grow up. This is what we do and you knew that when you signed up”

“Bullshit” Harold mumbled thru a wry smile, his hand white knuckling a pen, seemingly displaying how he truly felt inside.

Afraid

And Dawson knew it.

----------------------------

As Dawson sat in the mess hall to collect his thoughts, he saw his teammates approach, bickering as usual, with two trays holding two very different meals. Harold’s tray carried an almost comical amount of food, the spaghetti overflowing onto the desert. Beth’s tray represented a much more balanced meal, maybe too balanced for her own good. Rabbit food doesn’t get you through traumatic experiences, comfort food does, Dawson thought to himself.

“Why the long face captain O’captain, I’m starting to think you don’t like me.”

Harold said, a singular noodle hanging off the edge of his tray as he got closer.

“Do you hear yourself talk or do you just say whatever thought comes through your head? Can’t you see he’s thinking?” 

Dawson looked at them both and felt a certain warmth underneath the slight annoyance of hearing them argue needlessly.

“sit down we need to talk, and please concentrate I’m not messing around on this one”

They both sat down, Harold seemingly more concentrated on whether to start with the pudding or the salad than listening, meanwhile Beth sat with her arms crossed, staring at Dawson over her glasses as her food sat untouched. 

“ONI wants us to find the solaris 2, I tried doing my homework but everything is classified, down to the shoe size of the crew. Reached out to TARDUS 6 and they informed me of the true nature of the solaris program. Barnes is not being honest about everything” 

Harold almost choked on his food, and than erupted into laughter.

“So your telling me the office of naval intelligence is lying” 

Harold stated sarcastically as he promptly resumed his feast.  

“The sun is dying”

Harold froze mid bite and looked up, Beth’s posture remain unchanged.

“we are only a couple thousand years away from the sun dying, which explains the current living conditions on earth. ONI wants this under wraps for obvious reasons. Solaris 2 was launched from Martian orbit 7 years ago carrying a payload so secret I’m assuming it has to be the mother of all bombs.”

Beth broke her silence

“ONI never ceases to amaze me with their ability to throw bombs at every single one of their problems. Are you sure about this captain?”

“No, but what I am sure of is that if it’s not a bomb it must be way worse. Not even the Senators are aware of this. Its real spooky shit”

Dawson paused, looked back down at his boots, and resumed

“Our search and rescue operation is under the same classification, I looked us up, We no longer exist. The nautilus is undergoing the necessary modifications to carry us into mercury’s orbit as we speak. We leave at 0300 hours in two earth days”  

“What the fuck do you mean we don’t exist, I’m sitting hear having the conversation of a lifetime with my favourite captain and your telling me I don’t exist?”

“I’m telling you we don’t exist, would you like me to draw a picture Harold?”

Beth looked bothered  

“Mercury is almost deep space, are we getting there via CHERUB?”

“Won’t need one, time isn’t of the essence. We will enter Cryosleep”

“Whoa, nobody talked about fucking cryosleep. I’ve never gone under and I don’t plan on starting now”

Harold promptly got up with a smile so wide it could have wrapped around his head.

“There is a first time for everything Beth, I for one, am looking forward to it”

Dawson saw the fear not in Harold this time, but in Beth’s unwavering stare.
